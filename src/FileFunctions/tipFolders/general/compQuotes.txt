fix one bug, compile it again,
101 little bugs in the code.
101 little bugs in the code....

Brian Russell's Laws of Software Relativity (cf. Belady and Lehman's Laws of Software Evolution) 
*As a software project approaches release, its mass increases. 
*The energy required to release a software project is inversely proportional to the time before a scheduled release. 
*It takes infinite energy to release a finished product on time; therefore, all software projects are both incomplete and late. 
*Time is relative to the observer of a software project. The last month of development appears to an outside observer to take a year. 
*If a software project becomes too large, it will collapse into a black hole. Time and money are absorbed but nothing ever comes out.

Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. 
So far, the Universe is winning.

The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time...

Theory is when you know something, but it doesn’t work. 
Practice is when something works, but you don’t know why. 
Programmers combine theory and practice: Nothing works and they don’t know why.

There are two ways of constructing a software design: 
One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. 
The first method is far more difficult.

Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.
