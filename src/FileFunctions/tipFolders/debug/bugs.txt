It's not that I'm surrounded by incompetence that bothers me, it's that I fit in so well.

Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. 
Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.

We know about as much about software quality problems as they knew about the Black Plague in the 1600s. 
We've seen the victims' agonies and helped burn the corpses. We don't know what causes it; we don't really know if there is only one disease. 
We just suffer — and keep pouring our sewage into our water supply.
— Tom Van Vleck.

The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit.

Programmers and old people have a lot in common. We're both always looking for ways to control leaks and dumps.

It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa.
^ 
It is twice as difficult to debug a program as to write it. 
Therefore, if you put all of your creativity and effort into writing the program, you are not smart enough to debug it.

It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a DestroyBaghdad procedure. 
Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a DestroyCity procedure, to which Baghdad could be given as a parameter.
