What is the most basic level, that the phenomena still happens? 

Narrow down what the problem is 

What are the problem boundaries? 

In what specific circumstances does the problem happen? 

What is the exact point of failure? 

In what subsystem, or package does the problem occur? 

Zero in 

Narrowing down helps to pin responsibility 

Observe the bug happening, a number of times 

What is the root cause? 

What component is causing the failure? 
^
Isolate the problem 
^
What data collection could help you narrow down the problem? 
^
Compare to historical logs or data to find out when the problem began 
^
Where in the flow does the failure happen? 
^
When in the software development, did the problem begin to happen? 
^
If the problem is recent, what were the recent code changes in code related to the failure? 
^
Did the problem occur in the previous version? 
^
What are the code changes relative to the previous version? 
^
Check at the interface between subsystems. Is the problem already there, at the interface call? 
^
Narrowing down the problem helps decide if the bug is in your jurisdiction or not 
^
Is it a hardware or software problem? 
^
Does the problem occur consistently across other configurations? 
^
Does the problem occur consistently across other hardware? 
^
Narrowing down the problem helps in figuring out who you can discuss the problem with 
^
Drill down 
^
What functionality options can you turn off? Does the problem still occur 
^
To narrow down the problem, you need to be able to reproduce the problem
