Understand what data can be collected 

Learn how data collection can be controlled 

Where do the results go? 

Is there any documentation? 

Do you have any documentation of similar problems? 

Do you have any documentation of the particular software subsystem, or package? 

Was the data collected at the failure point of time, or was it collected too late? 

Program your code to collect the data you need, next time the problem occurs. 

Compare data of a failure, with data of a success 

Collect data of successes, to be able to compare to the failures. 

Have there been recent environmental changes? 

What control flags should you check? 

What indicators should you check? 

Notice what other people look at 

What are the key indicators? 

Start by reviewing the bug report 

What are the key controls controlling data collection? 

Is this an already known bug? 

Check which code files have been updated lately 

Look at the code change history in the configuration management system 

Collect GUI snapshots, at the time the bug occurred 
^
Look at the available disk space 
^
Setup code that automatically collects debug data 
^
Create a utility that enables users encountering bugs to easily collect critical bug data 
^
What version are they running? 
^
What data can you ask the person who reported the bug to collect? 
^
At what time did the problem occur? 
^
Learn what data collection is available or important at the specific subsystem level 
^
Reflect what data collection is important for different types of bugs. E.g. what data collection is important in a case of a deadlock? 
^
What data could help you to reproduce the problem? 
^
Look at the configuration management history in the code areas related to the problem 
^
Strive to automate the data you standardly collect 
^
Understand how the feature is used 
^
Go over the usage flow with the bug reporter. Sometimes they use the software in a sequence you would not have imagined. 
^
Ask the bug reporter if the problem happens consistently 
^
Ask the bug reporter if he has seen the bug before 
^
Collect the software logs
