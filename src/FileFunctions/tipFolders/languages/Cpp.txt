
Fifty years of programming language research, and we end up with C++ ??? 
~Richard A. O'Keefe

I invented the term 'Object-Oriented', and I can tell you I did not have C++ in mind 
~Alan Kay, creator of Smalltalk

C++: Hard to learn and built to stay that way

Java is, in many ways, C++--

Friends, much as in real life, are often more trouble than their worth 
~Scott Meyers on friend functions in C++

Ever spend a little time reading comp.lang.c++ ? That's really the best place to learn about the number of C++ users looking for a better language 
~R. William Beckwith

The evolution of languages: FORTRAN is a non-typed language. C is a weakly typed language. Ada is a strongly typed language. C++ is a strongly hyped language 
~Ron Sercely

PL/I and Ada started out with all the bloat, were very daunting languages, and got bad reputations (deservedly). 

C++ has shown that if you slowly bloat up a language over a period of years, people don't seem to mind as much

C++ : Where friends have access to your private members

C++ would make a decent teaching language if we could teach the ++ part without the C part

The great thing about Object Oriented code is that it can make small, simple problems look like large, complex ones
^ 
In C++ it's harder to shoot yourself in the foot, but when you do, you blow off your whole leg
~Bjarne Stroustrup

Hybrid ('half-assed') object languages like C++ are worst of all, 
as they unite the simplicity of Brainf*ck with the inherent security of C and the speed of Perl
